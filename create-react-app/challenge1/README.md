# Challenge 1

Please fix the javascript code so the tests pass.

There are two functions.

The `bottom` function takes an array of numbers, and should return all of the numbers below the average.

The `top` function takes an array of numbers, and should return all numbers above the average.

To test your code, you can run `npm install` to install dependencies then `npm run test` to run tests.

The `test.js` directory contains the tests that are run by `npm run test`. You can use it as a reference.
