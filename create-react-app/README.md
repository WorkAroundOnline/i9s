# Create React App Interview

**If you view this material prior to the interview, you won't be eligible for the interview, if you're interviewing at WorkAround in the near future stop reading!**

This interview assesses your ability to work and learn modern web technologies in the React stack.

Exercises can build on the concepts of each other and be difficult. You should use both online resources and your interviewer. Because the maximum time for this interview is 50 minutes, you may not finish.

To begin, go into the `challenge1` directory and read the README.md. After that, proceed to the `challenge2` directory.

**You are not tested on algorithm speed like a traditional technical interview,
or on best practices, focus on getting through each challenge.**

## Tips for Cloud9 Usage

- You have an editor that you're viewing this README in. You'll also edit code here.
- Below this editor is a terminal window. You'll need to use that terminal window to execute commands in each challenge directory.
- The basic commands you'll need are `cd`, `ls`, and `npm` ask your interviewer if you need help because you're not expected to know linux commands for this interview.
- For some of the challenges you'll be viewing web pages. To view any application running on port 8080, click on `Tools > Preview > Preview Running Application`
